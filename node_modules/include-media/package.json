Some of them wouldn't let me mix set breakpoints with case-specific values, others wouldn't properly handle the CSS OR operator and most of them had a syntax that I found complicated and unnatural.\n\n**include-media** was the result of that experience and it includes all the features I wish I had found before, whilst maintaining a simplistic and natural syntax.\n\n## How to install\n\n- With Bower: `bower install include-media`\n- Manually: get [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/master/dist/_include-media.scss)\n\nFinally, include the file in your project using an `@import` statement.\n\n## How to use\n\nExamples can be found [here](http://include-media.com/#features).\n\n## Plugins\n\n- [include-media-export](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-export) - Reference **include-media** breakpoints in JavaScript.\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [include-media.com](http://include-media.com)\n- [Documentation](http://include-media.com/documentation/)\n- [Approaches to Media Queries in Sass](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) (CSS-Tricks)\n- [Write Simple, Elegant and Maintainable Media Queries with Sass](http://davidwalsh.name/sass-media-query) (David Walsh blog)\n- [Generating Alternative Stylesheets for Browsers Without @media](http://davidwalsh.name/generating-alternative-stylesheets-browsers-media) (David Walsh blog)\n- [Create Simple Inline Media Queries with include-media](http://webdevstudios.com/2015/05/18/create-simple-inline-media-queries-include-media/) (WebDevStudios)\n- [Breakpoints and Tweakpoints in Sass](http://www.sitepoint.com/breakpoints-tweakpoints-sass/) (SitePoint)\n\n## The authors\n\nWe are [Eduardo Bouças](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas) and [Hugo Giraudel](https://twitter.com/hugogiraudel).\n\n## We want to hear from you\n\nWe'll be on the lookout for your [issues](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/pulls) — but make sure you read [this](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any code!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under [the terms of the MIT license](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
